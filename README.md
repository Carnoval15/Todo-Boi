# Notice,
 since I'm working on other project, I wont update the code, feel free to fork it for your projects.
# Todo-Boi
 A simple todo CLI app

## Notes:
- The whole app is under Active development (The reason I haven't put an installation way, but if you know how to install the app, please create an issue when you encounter bugs in it)
- At this point the app will create a text file to store the Tasks, I haven't programmed the file to be created in `%localappdata%\Todo-Boi` but, as soon as I have enough time, I will. Right now, the file will be created at `[User]`, (just write your username at File Explorer)
